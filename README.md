`Rocket Pool` is a first of its kind Ethereum Proof of Stake (PoS) infrastructure service, designed to be highly decentralised, distributed and compatible with staking in Ethereum  2.0 on the beacon chain. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had several successful public betas over the life span of ETH2 development. The staking network allows any individual, business, defi dapp, wallet provider, SaaS provider, exchange — just about any service — the ability to provide their users with the option to earn staking rewards on their ETH holdings without worrying about maintaining an extensive staking infrastructure, just plug and play.

Staking with the Rocket Pool network is very flexible and unlike any other staking infrastructure for Ethereum 2.0 to date. When depositing ETH into the Rocket Pool smart contracts, you will be instantly issued a token called rETH which represents a tokenised staking deposit in the network. Its value and the rewards it gains over time will be reflected by the work each individual decentralised node operator gives the Rocket Pool network. Rocket Pool’s unique decentralised staking infrastructure is economically bonded to both be secure and scalable.
