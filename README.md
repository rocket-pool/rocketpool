# Rocket Pool - Decentralised Ethereum Liquid Staking Protocol

Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum liquid staking protocol. It lets people participate in Ethereum staking without needing to run a full validator with 32 ETH, and it also lowers the technical barrier for running nodes. Here’s a breakdown:

### For Regular Stakers
- Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH by depositing into Rocket Pool’s smart contracts
- In return, they receive rETH (Rocket Pool ETH), a liquid staking token that automatically accrues staking rewards over time
- rETH can be traded, used in DeFi, or redeemed for ETH + rewards

### For Node Operators
- People who want to run validator nodes can join Rocket Pool by staking 8 ETH (instead of the full 32 ETH)
- Rocket Pool pairs that 8 ETH with the ETH deposited by rETH users to make a full validator
- They earn consensus rewards (ETH) plus commission from the rETH users for running the node

### Why It’s Different
- Lower capital requirement, 8 ETH instead of 32 ETH
- Better yield than solo staking for node operators
- Decentralized alternative to centralized exchanges’ staking services
- Permissionless: anyone can run a node, no approval required
- rETH token means stakers don’t have their ETH locked; they can use rETH across DeFi
